# Exoplanet Detection and Classification

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook reports for detecting exoplanets using the transit method and classifying exoplanets using machine learning algorithms.

## Exoplanet Detection using Transit Method

The `Exoplanet Detection_transit.ipynb` notebook demonstrates a method for detecting exoplanets using transit data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and lightkurves obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) website. The main library used for this analysis is `lightkurve`, a powerful tool for working with astronomical time-series data. T

## Exoplanet Classification using Machine Learning

The `exoplanet_rep.ipynb` notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification of exoplanets using machine learning algorithms. The analysis is performed on a dataset named `cumulative.csv` obtained from a Kaggle source. The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is explored to gain insights into its structure and content.
2. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization are performed to prepare the data for machine learning.
3. Machine Learning Classification: Various machine learning algorithms are applied to classify exoplanets into different categories based on available features.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics and techniques to assess their performance.

Please refer to the respective Jupyter Notebook files for detailed code implementations and explanations.
